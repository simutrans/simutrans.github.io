# Adding new events

You can add new events to the Simutrans Timeline by editing the *.js files located in this repository. You can do this directly within 's web interface, by opening the file and then clicking "Edit this file" button (pencil icon).
- Simutrans (Standard) events are in [standard.js](./standard.js).
- Simutrans Extended events are in [extended.js](./extended.js).
- Simutrans OTRP events are in [otrp.js](./otrp.js).
- Simutrans Iron Bite events are in [ironbite.js](./ironbite.js).

There are four types of events:
- "milestones" for important events (or big features)
- "contributors" for contributor-related events (someone joining, for exmaple)
- "paksets" for paksets releases or other pakset-related events
- "releases" for program releases

## Example
Adding events is easy. Let's see it with an example. Suppose You are a 'standard' contributor that wants to add the date you joined.
1. Open [standard.js](./standard.js)
2. Go to the ``List of contributors events`` section (you can do CTRL+F to fin it). You will see a code with a list like this:
```
// List of contributors events
const add_standard_contributors = (events) => {
  const short_events = [
    {start: '2009-07-29', content: "Ters joins"},
    {start: '2010-02-04', content: "TurfIt joins"},
    //etc...
  ]
  short_events.forEach((event) => events.add([{...event, group: 'standard', subgroup: 'contributor', className:'contributor'}]));
}
```
3. Simply add an item to the short_events list with the date (YYY-MM-DD) and content of the event, following the format you see (you can optionally add some HTML tags to the content, like an image for example). Please try to keep the list ordered by date.
```
  const short_events = [
    {start: '2009-07-29', content: "Ters joins"},
    {start: '2010-01-30', content: "I JOINED HERE"},
    {start: '2010-02-04', content: "TurfIt joins"},
  ]
```
4. Send your changes and we will approve it as soon as possible. After that, you will see them online.
